# TilesPlayer
This is a video player using Windows 10 live-tiles. Powered-by my [WinUIEssential](https://github.com/HO-COOH/WinUIEssentials).

## Usage
1. Build and run the project
2. Agree to add all secondary tiles when the app launches.
3. ~~Manually resize all the tiles to small size~~ (Supports medium-size 170*170 tiles now) In the start menu, and arrange them according to their number in row first order.
4. Load a video file.

## Build
To build this, you need `opencv4`, and I recommend installing that with `vcpkg`
```
vcpkg install opencv4:x64-uwp
```
